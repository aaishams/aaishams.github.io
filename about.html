    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I'm a third-year Biotechnology
        Engineering student deeply
        passionate about both programming,
        especially in Python, and Biological
        Sciences. Thus, I aspire to pursue
        higher studies in Bioinformatics.
        With strong leadership skills from
        volunteering and project
        management, I excel in problem-solving, organization, and
        coordination. My effective
        communication and attentive
        listening further enhance my ability
        to contribute meaningfully.</p>
